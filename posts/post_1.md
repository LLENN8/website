so yeah… this is my first post on my own website.

actually, i used to blog on bearblog. it’s a great platform, super clean, simple, and just works. but over time i felt kinda bored and a bit limited, especially when i wanted to mess around with the theme and customize stuff (not using the paid version either, lol). so i thought, why not just build my own web?

this site is built with the Wt library. You might think if use WT is kinda overkill? yep, it is. but honestly, i had fun. no deep technical reason behind why i am using it. maybe because i thought it was cool, but most important to me is i feel enjoy when writing the code. Also i learning a lot of new things along the way. like how routing works, what mpa vs spa even means, and so on.

i’ve made a few websites before but always gave up halfway, usually because i had to deal with javascript. nothing against js, it's powerful and all but it just doesn’t suits with me. i’m not the kind of person who uses programming as a tool to build stuff quickly. i code for fun. and if something doesn’t feel fun, i stop. simple as that.

some people might say this whole setup could be done with just html and css. they’re probably right. but it wouldn’t be as fun for me.

anyway, this is just a place for me to share whatever i feel like. no big plans. thanks for reading
